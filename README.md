This is the backend repository for [this project](https://github.com/melgrove/restaurant-xgboost). I shut down the web server because the project ended and it was still costing me hosting fees. This repository has some of the backend code which performs the model inference and serves it over HTTP. Some of the code is specific to Google App Engine. None of the SQLite stuff ended up working because App Engine doesn't support it, but it's a pretty nice solution for other platforms (probably). Instead I had to use one of Google's NoSQL products which was somewhat of a pain.

This repo also has the model training code, which is much worse, since it was done in a Google Colab notebook very rushed. Some of the code between the two files is the same, since preprocessing has to be completed in the same way for the queries and the training data.
